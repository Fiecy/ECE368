This PA has a postorder input. So, my algorithm is establish a stack first. If the input is a leaf node, push(node). If the input is a non-leaf node('V' or 'H'), Node->right = pop(); Node->left = pop(), to build the binary tree. Time complexity: O(n).
When calculating the area, use a postorder traversal with time complexity O(n) to go through all the node. Algorithm is : go to left most; go to right most; if Node is a non-leaf node [find the leaf node and return to a non-leaf node], calculate the area of this node. Return to it's parent, and use the area of this node to calculate the area of its parent.
When calculating the position of each leaf node, assume the position of the top node is (0,0). When go to its sub-node, use its (V or H) (L or R) (UP or DOWN) to calculate the position of the sub-node. When reaching the leaf node, assign the position to it's x and y. Compare the label, if the label is larger than the maxlabel, set maxlabel = label, maxx = x, maxy = y. Time complexity is also O(n).
Print the statement on screen: roomwidth, roomheight, maxwidth, maxheight.
Use postorder traversal to write the position of each leaf node in the output file. Time complexity is O(n).

Conclusion: All of the steps above has a time complexity is O(n).
